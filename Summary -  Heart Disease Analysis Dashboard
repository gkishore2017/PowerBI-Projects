🔍 Project Objective:
This project aims to analyze and visualize heart disease data to uncover patterns and risk factors associated with heart-related health issues. 
The dashboard provides stakeholders—such as healthcare professionals, analysts, or policymakers—with clear, data-driven insights that can aid in early 
detection and preventive healthcare planning.

📊 Key Metrics & Insights Provided:
Patient Demographics:
Distribution by age and gender to highlight at-risk groups.
Age group segmentation to show how heart disease prevalence changes with age.

Medical and Lifestyle Factors:
Impact of cholesterol levels, blood pressure, resting ECG, chest pain types, and fasting blood sugar on heart disease.
Relationship between exercise-induced angina and heart disease occurrence.

Risk Factor Correlations:
Identifies which features (like maximum heart rate, thalassemia, or oldpeak) are most associated with heart disease diagnosis.
Compares patients with and without heart disease across multiple variables.

Heart Disease Classification:
A binary classification (presence vs. absence) of heart disease using existing data columns for easier analysis.

🧰 Tools and Techniques Used:
Power BI for building interactive visualizations and slicers to explore the data dynamically.
Power Query to clean and transform the raw CSV data (heart_disease_dataset.csv).
DAX Measures to calculate averages, segment populations, and derive key health indicators.
Data Modeling to connect various dimensions (e.g., demographics and health indicators) into a coherent reporting structure.

📈 Outcomes and Impact:
Helps identify high-risk individuals based on demographic and health features.
Supports data-driven preventive care planning and awareness campaigns.
Enables users to drill down into specific segments (e.g., age group, gender) for targeted interventions.
Demonstrates how visual analytics can simplify complex medical datasets for actionable insights.

📁 Files Included:
Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard.pbix: The interactive Power BI dashboard file.
Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard.pdf: A visual summary report in PDF format.
heart_disease_dataset.csv: The dataset used for the analysis.
