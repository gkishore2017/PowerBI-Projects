üîç Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze operational efficiency and customer service performance in a call center using Power BI. By transforming raw call data
into meaningful visual insights, this dashboard helps management make informed decisions to improve agent productivity, customer satisfaction, and overall call
center effectiveness.

üìä Key Metrics & Insights Provided:
Total Calls Received: Displays call volume trends across different days, weeks, or months.
Average Call Handling Time: Helps evaluate how long agents take to resolve calls, which reflects on both efficiency and training needs.
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Scores: Visualizes satisfaction ratings, highlighting areas needing service improvement.
Call Abandonment Rates: Identifies how often customers disconnect before speaking to an agent, pointing to staffing or wait time issues.
Peak Call Hours: Analyzes time-of-day trends to optimize agent scheduling and resource allocation.
Agent Performance Analysis: Compares agents on metrics such as calls handled, resolution rates, and feedback scores.

üß∞ Tools and Techniques Used:
Power BI for building the dashboard with interactive visuals and slicers.
DAX Measures to calculate KPIs such as average handling time, call volumes by hour, and satisfaction percentages.
Data Cleaning and transformation in Power Query for formatting and filtering raw Excel data (Call_Center_Dataset.xlsx).

üìà Outcomes and Impact:
Provided a clear overview of performance at both a team and individual agent level.
Helped identify operational bottlenecks, peak traffic times, and underperforming areas.
Enabled data-driven decisions for training, hiring, and customer experience improvements.

üìÅ Files Included:
Call Center Analysis Dashboard.pbix: The Power BI report file with interactive visuals.
Call Center Analysis Dashboard.pdf: A static version for sharing insights offline.
Call_Center_Dataset.xlsx: The source dataset used for the analysis.
